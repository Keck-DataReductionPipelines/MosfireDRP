This manual describes the installation and usage of the MOSFIRE data reduction pipeline on a unix-like computer. Although primarily tested and developed on a Mac, the pipeline operates on both OSX and Linux systems. In the section 4, we describe an installation procedure for a Mac OSX system. Later sections describe code usage, execution, and outputs.

The MOSFIRE spectrograph data reduction pipeline was architected by the MOSFIRE commissioning team and written by Nick Konidaris with extensive checking and feedback from Chuck Steidel and other MOSFIRE team members. The pipeline is maintained on an online code repository [https://github.com/Keck-DataReductionPipelines/MosfireDRP](https://github.com/Keck-DataReductionPipelines/MosfireDRP). Please use this website to track issues and and submit requests.
